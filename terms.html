    <h1 class="text-center">Terms of Services</h1>
                                <p><b>In using this website you are deemed to have read and agreed to the following terms of services:</b></p>


<p>The following terminology applies to these Terms of Services, Privacy Statement and Disclaimer Notice and any or all Agreements: "Client", “You” and “Your” refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting the Loandisk’s Terms of Services. "The Loandisk", “Ourselves”, “We” and "Us", refers to our Loandisk. “Party”, “Parties”, or “Us”, refers to both the Client and ourselves, or either the Client or ourselves. All terms refer to the offer, acceptance and consideration of payment necessary to undertake the process of our assistance to the Client in the most appropriate manner, whether by formal meetings of a fixed duration, or any other means, for the express purpose of meeting the Client’s needs in respect of provision of the Loandisk’s stated services/products, in accordance with and subject to, prevailing Australian Law. Any use of the above terminology or other words in the singular, plural, capitalisation and/or he/she or they, are taken as interchangeable and therefore as referring to same.</p>


<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. Authorized employees within the Loandisk on a need to know basis only use any information collected from individual customers. We constantly review our systems and data to ensure the best possible service to our customers. Parliament has created specific offences for unauthorised actions against computer systems and data. We will investigate any such actions with a view to prosecuting and/or taking civil proceedings to recover damages against those responsible</p>


<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Client records are regarded as confidential and therefore will not be divulged to any third party, other than [our manufacturer/supplier(s) and] if legally required to do so to the appropriate authorities. Clients have the right to request sight of, and copies of any and all Client Records we keep, on the proviso that we are given reasonable notice of such a request. Clients are requested to retain copies of any literature issued in relation to the provision of our services. Where appropriate, we shall issue Client’s with appropriate written information, handouts or copies of records as part of an agreed contract, for the benefit of both parties.</p>

<p>We will not sell, share, or rent your personal information to any third party or use your e-mail address for unsolicited mail. Any emails sent by this Loandisk will only be in connection with the provision of agreed services and products.</p>


<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p><b>Exclusions and Limitations</b><br>
    The information on this web site is provided on an "as is" basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, this Loandisk:
<ul>
    <li>excludes all representations and warranties relating to this website and its contents or which is or may be provided by any affiliates or any other third party, including in relation to any inaccuracies or omissions in this website and/or the Loandisk’s literature; and</li>
    <li>excludes all liability for damages arising out of or in connection with your use of this website. This includes, without limitation, direct loss, loss of business or profits (whether or not the loss of such profits was foreseeable, arose in the normal course of things or you have advised this Loandisk of the possibility of such potential loss), damage caused to your computer, computer software, systems and programs and the data thereon or any other direct or indirect, consequential and incidental damages. </li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2>Payment</h2>
<p>Cash or Personal Cheque with Bankers Card, all major Credit/Debit Cards, Bankers Draft, and Paypal  are all acceptable methods of payment. Our Terms are payment in full within fourteen days. All goods remain the property of the Loandisk until paid for in full. We reserve the right to seek recovery of any monies remaining unpaid sixty days from the date of invoice via collection Agencies and/or through the Small Claims Court. In such circumstances, you shall be liable for any and all additional administrative and/or court costs. </p>

<p>Returned cheques will incur a $100 charge to cover banking fees and administrative costs. In an instance of a second Returned cheque, we reserve the right to terminate the arrangement and, if agreed to, we shall insist on future cash transactions only. Consequently, all bookings and/or transactions and agreements entered into will cease with immediate effect until such time as any and all outstanding monies are recovered in full.   </p>

<p>We do not accept payment from countries who are in the OFAC designated lists.</p>

<h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
<p>Minimum 24 hours notice of cancellation required. Notification for instance, in person, via email, mobile phone ‘text message’ and/or fax, or any other means will be accepted subject to confirmation in writing. There are no cancellation charges.</p>

<h2>Termination of Agreements and Refunds Policy</h2>
<p>Both the Client and ourselves have the right to terminate any Services Agreement for any reason, including the ending of services that are already underway. No refunds shall be offered, where a Service is deemed to have begun and is, for all intents and purposes, underway. Any monies that have been paid to us which constitute payment in respect of the provision of unused Services, shall be refunded.</p>

Any Party affected by such event shall forthwith inform the other Party of the same and shall use all reasonable endeavours to comply with the Terms of Services of any Agreement contained herein.</p>


<h2>Waiver</h2>
<p>Failure of either Party to insist upon strict performance of any provision of this or any Agreement or the failure of either Party to exercise any right or remedy to which it, he or they are entitled hereunder shall not constitute a waiver thereof and shall not cause a diminution of the obligations under this or any Agreement. No waiver of any of the provisions of this or any Agreement shall be effective unless it is expressly stated to be such and signed by both Parties.</p>

If any of these terms are deemed invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, but not limited to the exclusions and limitations set out above), then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be severed from these terms and the remaining terms will continue to apply. Failure of the Loandisk to enforce any of the provisions set out in these Terms of Services and any Agreement, or failure to exercise any option to terminate, shall not be construed as waiver of such provisions and shall not affect the validity of these Terms of Services or of any Agreement or any part thereof, or the right thereafter to enforce each and every provision. These Terms of Services shall not be amended, modified, varied or supplemented except in writing and signed by duly authorised representatives of the Loandisk.</p>
